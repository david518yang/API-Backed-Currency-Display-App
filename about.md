App Description:

This is a currency exchange viewer and converter app created by David Yang and Sung Jae Ko. Our app uses a currency API to display live currency values
from all over the world. We allow the user to select a base currency and amount to convert to then display an array of currencies.

API Description:

We used a free foreign exchange, crypto rates & EU VAT rates API. "This API comes with multiple endpoints, each serving a different use case. The endpoint
functionalities include getting the latest exchange rate data for all or a specific set of currencies, convreting amounts from one currency to another, 
retrieving Time-Series data for one or multiple currencies and querying the API for daily fluctuation data."
